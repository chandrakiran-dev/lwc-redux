# Introducing Redux with Lightning web components(LWC)

[LWC-redux](http://lwc-redux.com/) is a [LWC](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2018/12/introducing-lightning-web-components.html) binding for [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started#basic-example). It will allow your Lightning Web Components to read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data.

There are two types of developer processes or models supported in Salesforce Extensions for VS Code and Salesforce CLI. These models are explained below. Each model offers pros and cons and is fully supported.

## Why Use LWC Redux?

Redux itself is a standalone library that can be used with any UI layer or framework, including LWC, React, Angular, Vue, Ember, and vanilla JS. Although Redux and React are commonly used together, they are independent of each other.

If you are using Redux with any kind of UI framework, you will normally use a "UI binding" library to tie Redux together with your UI framework, rather than directly interacting with the store from your UI code.

LWC Redux is the Redux UI binding library for LWC. If you are using Redux and LWC together, you should also use LWC Redux to bind these two libraries.
